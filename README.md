- 👀 I’m interested in comparative genomics. Although still too early to tell, but I find molecular evolution interesting.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the methods of pangenomics, especially graph-based approaches.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any bioinformatics projects. I know how to code using r and python.
